== Simple topological order generator on cyclic inverse dependency graphs.

== Building from Source
The application can be easily built with the
https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper]. You also need JDK 1.8.

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need
http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.2.1 or above].

NOTE: You may need to increase the amount of memory available to Maven by setting
a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with the value `-Xmx512m`.

NOTE: To compile/work with the code in your IDE you most probably need to install Lombok plugin.

== Running tests

[indent=0]
----
	$ ./mvnw test
----

The regular `mvn` command can also be used.

== Design Considerations

I've used a well known algorithm to calculate node order:

Depth first search is implemented as a reusable component using the visitor pattern.
